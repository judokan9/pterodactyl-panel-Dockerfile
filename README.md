## Pterodactyl Panel container
This container is built to run the pterodactyl server management panel.

Built from the stock [alpine linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) using the build in edge repositories to get the latest PHP 7 on top of nginx. Supervisord starts both nginx and php-fpm.

Quay.io Build Status  
![status badge](https://quay.io/repository/parkervcp/pterodactyl-panel/status)

## Running the container
Pull the container  
```docker pull quay.io/parkervcp/pterodactyl-panel```

You can use the docker-compose.yml to run the containers if you want. This will start a mariadb container and link it to the panel. This connection is internal only.  
You run the containers by running
```docker-compose -d```

More info on docker-compose can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

###When you first start the container you need to wait at least 1 minute for it to complete the final setup including the database configuration/seeding, email setup, and user generation.

#####If you don't use docker-compose
The container requires a database to run as well. I recommend the [mariadb conatiner](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/). I start it with a command like this. Modify to your needs.  
```docker run -t -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=apassword -e MYSQL_DATABASE=pterodb -e MYSQL_USER=ptero -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pterodbpass --name pterodb -d mariadb:10```
The container also requires a ton of env flags and that is why the docker-compose is the recommended way to run the container

```docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v /srv/pterodactyl/.env:/var/www/html/.env --link pterodb -e db_host=pterodb -e db_port=3306 -e db_name=pterodb -e db_user=ptero -e db_pass=pterodbpass -e panel_url= -e timezon e="America/New_York" -e email_driver=mail -e panel_email=foo@bar.org --name pterosite quay.io/parkervcp/pterodactyl-panel:latest```
The full list of supported env flags are:  
#####DB settings
db_host="hostname"  
db_port="port"  
db_name="db name"  
db_user="username"  
db_pass="db pass"
